'The DIIS algorithm will have as its input:
    A guess for the first order density matrix
    The zeroth order density matrix and pi tensor
    The first order pi tensor and one electron matrix 

It will then generate the first order Fock matrix and from this a revised
first order density matrix by using the get_P1 function'
